# TO-DO-LIST The To-Do List is a simple and interactive web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of the app, including input fields, buttons, and the task list.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly with layouts, colors, fonts, and responsive design.

JavaScript adds interactivity to the app, allowing users to:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

Optionally store tasks using browser local storage (for persistence)

This lightweight application runs entirely in the browser, with no need for a backend or external frameworks. Itâ€™s ideal for learning the fundamentals of front-end web development
